# Refactoring Plan

This document outlines a series of refactoring recommendations to improve the quality, maintainability, and extensibility of the Chat Analyzer application.

## 1. Decouple Core Application Logic

**Issue:** The `app.py` file is a "god object" that handles too many responsibilities, including API routing, authentication, session management, message processing, and bot webhooks. This tight coupling makes the code difficult to understand, test, and maintain.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Introduce a Service Layer:** Create a new `services` directory and introduce a `ChatService` class to encapsulate the core business logic for handling chat messages. This service will be responsible for orchestrating the interactions between the client implementations and the AI models.
*   **Create a Caching Service:** Introduce a `CacheService` to handle all caching logic. This service will provide a unified interface for caching data from different sources, including the Telegram and Webex clients.
*   **Refactor `app.py`:** Refactor `app.py` to be a thin routing layer that delegates all business logic to the appropriate services.

## 2. Improve Client Abstractions

**Issue:** The `ChatClient` abstraction is leaky, and the implementations are inconsistent. The `UnifiedBotClient` is an anti-pattern that should be eliminated.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Refine `ChatClient`:** Refine the `ChatClient` interface to better reflect the different authentication and message-handling requirements of the Telegram and Webex clients.
*   **Create a `BotClient` Interface:** Introduce a new `BotClient` abstract base class to define a common interface for all bot clients.
*   **Refactor Implementations:** Refactor the `TelegramClientImpl`, `WebexClientImpl`, `TelegramBotClientImpl`, and `WebexBotClientImpl` classes to implement the new `ChatClient` and `BotClient` interfaces.

## 3. Simplify Complex Logic

**Issue:** The `get_messages` methods in the `TelegramClientImpl` and `WebexClientImpl` classes are overly complex and difficult to understand. The logic for handling dates, caching, and pagination is convoluted and error-prone.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Simplify `get_messages`:** Refactor the `get_messages` methods to simplify the logic for handling dates, caching, and pagination.
*   **Introduce Helper Functions:** Introduce helper functions to encapsulate common logic, such as parsing dates and formatting messages.

## 4. Improve Configuration Management

**Issue:** The application's configuration is scattered across multiple files and is not well-organized.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Consolidate Configuration:** Consolidate all configuration into a single `config.py` file.
*   **Introduce a `Settings` Class:** Introduce a `Settings` class to provide a unified interface for accessing configuration values.

## 5. Enhance Error Handling

**Issue:** The application's error handling is inconsistent and not very robust.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Introduce Custom Exceptions:** Introduce custom exception classes to provide more specific error information.
*   **Implement a Global Exception Handler:** Implement a global exception handler to catch and handle all unhandled exceptions.
