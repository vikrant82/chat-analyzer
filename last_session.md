# Summary of Bot Integration Session

This document summarizes the work accomplished during our recent coding session focused on integrating Webex Bots into the Chat Analyzer application.

### High-Level Goal
The primary objective was to allow users to invoke the chat analysis features of the application by mentioning a registered bot within a Webex space.

### Key Accomplishments

1.  **Feature Design:**
    *   We designed a multi-backend architecture to ensure the feature is extensible to other platforms like Telegram in the future.
    *   The design includes a UI for managing bots and an automated webhook registration process to simplify user setup.

2.  **Backend Implementation:**
    *   A new `WebexBotClient` was created to handle API requests using a bot's token.
    *   API endpoints were added to manage the lifecycle of bots (register, list, delete) for each supported backend (`/api/webex/bots`, `/api/telegram/bots`).
    *   A webhook endpoint (`/api/bot/webex/webhook`) was implemented to receive and process incoming messages from Webex.
    *   We implemented robust logic to correctly identify the mentioned bot by decoding Base64-encoded IDs from the webhook payload and comparing them to the stored configuration.

3.  **Frontend Implementation:**
    *   A "Manage Bots" section was added to the UI, allowing authenticated users to register their bots.
    *   The UI was updated to use a clean table layout for displaying registered bots.
    *   The registration form includes an optional field for a public URL to trigger the automated webhook creation process.

4.  **Performance & Stability:**
    *   The application's configuration is now loaded only once at startup to improve performance, with in-memory updates synchronized to the `config.json` file.
    *   Multiple complex routing and JavaScript scoping issues were diagnosed and resolved, resulting in a stable and fully functional implementation.

### Current Status

*   The foundational infrastructure for bot integration is **complete and working**.
*   Users can successfully register a Webex bot, and the bot will post an acknowledgment message when mentioned in a Webex space.
*   The system correctly handles the complex ID correlation required by the Webex API.


**Next Steps: Completing the AI Bot Integration**

We have successfully built the foundational infrastructure for the bot. It can be registered, and it correctly responds when mentioned. Now, we need to replace the simple acknowledgment with the application's core AI analysis logic.

Here is the plan to achieve this:

1.  **Parse the User's Command:**
    *   In the `webex_webhook` function in [`app.py`](app.py:1), we need to parse the `message_text` to extract the user's actual command (e.g., "summarize last 2 days").
    *   We also need to determine the date range from the command. We can use a simple keyword search (e.g., "last 2 days", "yesterday") or a more robust natural language processing library to extract the start and end dates.

2.  **Fetch Chat History:**
    *   Using the `room_id` from the webhook and the extracted date range, we will use the `WebexBotClient` to fetch the relevant message history from the Webex space.

3.  **Invoke the AI Engine:**
    *   We will pass the fetched message history to the existing `llm_client.call_conversational` function, just as the main `/api/chat` endpoint does. This reuses our core AI logic.

4.  **Post the AI Response:**
    *   The AI-generated summary or answer will be taken from the `call_conversational` stream.
    *   We will then use the `WebexBotClient`'s `post_message` function to send this complete and formatted response back to the Webex space.

5.  **Handle Interactive Clarifications (Stretch Goal):**
    *   If the user's command is ambiguous (e.g., no date range), the AI engine can be prompted to return a clarifying question.
    *   The bot would then post this question to the space and temporarily store the conversation's context. When the user replies, the webhook handler would use this stored context to complete the original request.

By following these steps, we will transform the bot from a simple acknowledgment tool into a fully functional, AI-powered chat assistant.
