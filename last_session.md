In this session, we implemented the incoming message handling for the Telegram bot and refactored the bot clients.

## Key Accomplishments:

*   **Implemented Telegram Bot**: We implemented the incoming message handling for the Telegram bot. This included creating a new webhook endpoint and a function to process commands from Telegram bots.

## Next Steps:
