# Last Session Summary (2025-07-23)

In this session, we implemented the incoming message handling for the Telegram bot and refactored the bot clients.

## Key Accomplishments:

*   **Implemented Telegram Bot**: We implemented the incoming message handling for the Telegram bot. This included creating a new webhook endpoint and a function to process commands from Telegram bots.
*   **Refactored Bot Clients**: We refactored the `WebexBotClient` and `TelegramBotClient` to use a factory pattern with a unified interface. This makes the code cleaner and easier to extend.
*   **Created `clients/bot_factory.py`**: A new file, `clients/bot_factory.py`, was created to house the bot factory and the `UnifiedBotClient` class.
*   **Updated `bot_manager.py`**: We updated the bot manager to support the new bot factory.
*   **Updated `example-config.json`**: We added a new section for Telegram bots to the example config file.
*   **Updated Frontend**: We made some minor updates to the frontend to support the new Telegram bot functionality.

## Next Steps:

*   Test the Telegram bot integration to ensure it is working correctly.
*   Focus on overall stability and quality improvements.
