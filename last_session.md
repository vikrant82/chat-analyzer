### Key Accomplishments
- **LLM Abstraction Refactor:**
  - Introduced an `LLMManager` to encapsulate all LLM client logic, providing a single, unified interface for the rest of the application.
  - Refactored the `bot_service` and `chat_service` to use the new `LLMManager`, removing global state and decoupling the services from the specifics of the LLM clients.
- **Documentation:**
  - Updated `overview.md` and `refactor_plan.md` to reflect the new `LLMManager` architecture.

### Next Steps
- The application is now fully refactored. The next session can focus on new features or further enhancements.

### Key Accomplishments
- **Architectural Refactoring:**
  - Decomposed the monolithic `app.py` by creating a dedicated `routers` and `services` directory.
  - Moved all authentication-related endpoints (`/login`, `/logout`, `/verify`, `/callback`, `/session-status`) into a new `routers/auth.py` file.
  - Encapsulated all session management logic within a new `services/auth_service.py`, removing direct state access from the application layer.
  - Moved all download-related logic to `routers/downloads.py` and `services/download_service.py`.
- **Code Cleanup:**
  - Removed dead code and unused imports from `app.py`.
  - Standardized the application's architecture to follow a cleaner router/service pattern.

### Next Steps
- Continue refactoring the remaining endpoints in `app.py` (`/chat`, `/chats`, bot endpoints) to use the new service-based architecture.

### Key Accomplishments
- Fixed Google AI MIME handling to avoid 400 errors
  - Added MIME-type allowlist for Google AI inline images and filtered unsupported or missing data before sending.
  - Implemented change in `ai/google_ai_llm.py` to only pass supported image types (png/jpeg/gif/webp) and skip `application/octet-stream`.
  - Corrected imports to explicit modules per Pylance guidance.
- Honored image-processing settings consistently across providers
  - Telegram now respects image-processing enable/disable and size/MIME filters like Webex.
  - Added explicit log when disabled: “Image processing is disabled by configuration. Skipping file download.” in `clients/telegram_client_impl.py`.
- Persisted image-processing UI options (disabled by default)
  - Frontend now persists:
    - Enable/disable image processing checkbox (default: disabled)
    - Max image size (MB)
  - Implemented in `static/script.js` with keys:
    - IMAGE_PROCESSING_ENABLED_KEY
    - MAX_IMAGE_SIZE_KEY
  - Reads on load and updates localStorage on change.

### Notes/Decisions
- Default for image processing in the browser UI is disabled to control costs and avoid accidental multimodal requests.
- Persisted per-user preference in localStorage similar to caching preference.

### Suggested Next Steps
- Add a backend config fallback for max image size when UI value is missing/invalid.
- Consider surfacing allowed MIME list in the UI when needed (advanced settings).

# Session on 2025-08-02T21:53:48+05:30 (Local Day)

### Key Accomplishments
- Telegram threading preservation and reconstruction
  - Reconfirmed and documented the reply-chain reconstruction strategy in `clients/telegram_client_impl.py` and transcript packaging in `app.py`. Threads are reconstructed by resolving reply-chain roots, assigning a stable `thread_id` to the root, and grouping replies under that root. Orphaned chains are grouped by first-reply timestamp for deterministic ordering.
  - Transcript packaging emits explicit thread boundaries (“--- Thread Started/Ended ---”) and reply context hints for the LLM.
- Global image processing options (provider-agnostic)
  - UI exposes Image Processing Options for all providers; backend applies the same configuration to Telegram and Webex. Images are optionally downloaded, size/mime-gated, base64-encoded, and provided to multimodal models as structured `image_url` parts with adjacent caption grounding. See `static/script.js` and `app.py`.
- Local-day bucketing and caching (timezone-agnostic)
  - Local-day semantics are applied based on the user’s browser timezone (IANA tz, e.g., Asia/Kolkata) for day filtering, grouping, and per-day caching keys while preserving each provider’s native pagination. Removed IST-specific wording. See `clients/webex_client_impl.py` and `clients/telegram_client_impl.py`.
- Downloads with images
  - Added support for HTML (images embedded) and ZIP (transcript.txt, transcript_with_images.html, images/, manifest.json). TXT/PDF remain text-only.
- Prompt refinements
  - `ai/prompts.py` now explains the single-message transcript packaging up front, including thread markers and image markers, and removes any requirement for output-end packaging notes.

### Documentation Updates
- Updated `overview.md` to explicitly call out:
  - Telegram threading reconstruction and its benefit to reduce interleaving confusion.
  - Global image processing options as provider-agnostic.
  - The unified single-message transcript packaging described in the system prompt.
- Added short notes to:
  - `webex_bot_guide.md`: Mentions threading context preservation and image-processing behavior at a glance, and documents new downloads (TXT/PDF/HTML/ZIP) with images in HTML/ZIP.
  - `telegram_bot_guide.md`: Mentions threading reconstruction, image processing, and documents new downloads (TXT/PDF/HTML/ZIP) with images in HTML/ZIP.

### Next Validation Steps
- Validate with Telegram chats:
  - Interleaved reply chains and long chains for correct root resolution and ordering.
  - Images/stickers/GIFs under various size and MIME settings.
  - Cross-day ranges to confirm stable caching keys and local-root behavior.
- Add minimal logging for:
  - Thread root decisions and orphan handling.
  - Media inclusion/exclusion outcomes (enabled, size exceeded, MIME filtered).

# Session on 2025-08-02T14:31:54+05:30 (Local Day)

### Key Accomplishments:
- Webex date handling aligned to user-local timezone semantics
  - Implemented local-day filtering, grouping, and caching in `clients/webex_client_impl.py`, using start/end as user-local inclusive day range, converting messages to the user’s timezone before bucketing, and determining "today" in the user’s local timezone (IANA tz from browser).
  - Preserved Webex API pagination while switching comparisons to local-day windows.
- Telegram date handling made consistent with Webex and user-local timezone
  - Updated `clients/telegram_client_impl.py` to use user-local day windows, group/cache by local days, treat Telethon message timestamps as UTC if naive, and compute cacheability by the user’s local “today”.
- Verified behavior against user-provided screenshots and UX inputs: date selections in local-day now include messages exactly as shown for those days.
- No changes to message sorting format; ISO 8601 strings remain stable, with option to harden later by sorting on parsed datetimes.

### Decisions:
- Standardize all backends on user-local day semantics (based on browser-provided IANA timezone) for:
  - Request range interpretation
  - Inclusion filtering
  - Per-day caching keys and cacheability
- Keep provider API pagination unchanged; only adjust comparison windows to local-day equivalents.

### Key Accomplishments:

*   **Feature: Configurable Image Processing (Webex)**
    *   Implemented a new configuration section in `example-config.json` to allow global control over image processing, including enabling/disabling the feature, setting max file sizes, and defining allowed MIME types.
    *   Added a collapsible "Image Processing Options" section to the UI, which appears only for the Webex backend, allowing users to override global settings on a per-request basis.
    *   Updated the backend logic in `app.py` and `clients/webex_client_impl.py` to enforce these new rules.
*   **Bug Fixes & Hardening:**
    *   Resolved a critical timezone bug in `static/script.js` that caused incorrect date ranges to be sent to the backend.
    *   Fixed a caching flaw where the file-based cache was being used even when the user disabled caching in the UI.
    *   Addressed multiple `FPDFException` errors by implementing robust word-wrapping for long, unbreakable strings in the PDF generation logic.
    *   Reverted the PDF image embedding feature due to persistent rendering issues, ensuring the PDF download functionality remains stable and text-only.

# Session on Tuesday, July 29, 2025, 8:03 PM UTC

### Key Accomplishments:

*   **Prompt Engineering**: Refined the system prompt in `ai/prompts.py` to clarify how threaded conversations are handled, specifying that threads are replies to the immediately preceding message.
*   **Bug Fixes**:
    *   Corrected a bug in `app.py` where the conversation history was using the non-standard `model` role for the AI's responses. This has been changed to the standard `assistant` role for API compatibility.
    *   Fixed a logic error in `ai/openai_compatible_llm.py` where the conversation history was being incorrectly merged into the system prompt instead of being passed as a proper message list. This ensures the model receives the correct conversational context.
