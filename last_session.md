# Summary of Bot Integration Session

This document summarizes the work accomplished during our recent coding session focused on integrating Webex Bots into the Chat Analyzer application.

### High-Level Goal
The primary objective was to allow users to invoke the chat analysis features of the application by mentioning a registered bot within a Webex space.

### Key Accomplishments

1.  **Feature Design:**
    *   We designed a multi-backend architecture to ensure the feature is extensible to other platforms like Telegram in the future.
    *   The design includes a UI for managing bots and an automated webhook registration process to simplify user setup.

2.  **Backend Implementation:**
    *   A new `WebexBotClient` was created to handle API requests using a bot's token.
    *   API endpoints were added to manage the lifecycle of bots (register, list, delete) for each supported backend (`/api/webex/bots`, `/api/telegram/bots`).
    *   A webhook endpoint (`/api/bot/webex/webhook`) was implemented to receive and process incoming messages from Webex.
    *   We implemented robust logic to correctly identify the mentioned bot by decoding Base64-encoded IDs from the webhook payload and comparing them to the stored configuration.

3.  **Frontend Implementation:**
    *   A "Manage Bots" section was added to the UI, allowing authenticated users to register their bots.
    *   The UI was updated to use a clean table layout for displaying registered bots.
    *   The registration form includes an optional field for a public URL to trigger the automated webhook creation process.

4.  **Performance & Stability:**
    *   The application's configuration is now loaded only once at startup to improve performance, with in-memory updates synchronized to the `config.json` file.
    *   Multiple complex routing and JavaScript scoping issues were diagnosed and resolved, resulting in a stable and fully functional implementation.

### Current Status

*   The foundational infrastructure for bot integration is **complete and working**.
*   Users can successfully register a Webex bot, and the bot will post an acknowledgment message when mentioned in a Webex space.
*   The system correctly handles the complex ID correlation required by the Webex API.

### Next Steps
The immediate next step is to replace the simple acknowledgment message with the actual AI-powered summarization and Q&A logic, which will complete the feature's core functionality.
