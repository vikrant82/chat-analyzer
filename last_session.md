### Key Accomplishments:
- Webex date handling aligned to user-local timezone (IST) semantics
  - Implemented local-day filtering, grouping, and caching in [`python.WebexClientImpl.get_messages()`](clients/webex_client_impl.py:137), using start/end as IST-inclusive day range, converting messages to IST before bucketing, and determining "today" in IST.
  - Preserved Webex API pagination while switching comparisons to local-day windows.
- Telegram date handling made consistent with Webex and IST
  - Updated [`python.TelegramClientImpl.get_messages()`](clients/telegram_client_impl.py:144) to use IST-local day windows, group/cache by local days, treat Telethon message timestamps as UTC if naive, and compute cacheability by IST "today".
- Verified behavior against user-provided screenshots and UX inputs: date selections in IST now include messages exactly as shown in Webex for those days.
- No changes to message sorting format; ISO 8601 strings remain stable, with option to harden later by sorting on parsed datetimes.

### Decisions:
- Standardize all backends on user-local (IST) day semantics for:
  - Request range interpretation
  - Inclusion filtering
  - Per-day caching keys and cacheability
- Keep provider API pagination unchanged; only adjust comparison windows to local-day equivalents.

### Key Accomplishments:

*   **Feature: Configurable Image Processing (Webex)**
    *   Implemented a new configuration section in `example-config.json` to allow global control over image processing, including enabling/disabling the feature, setting max file sizes, and defining allowed MIME types.
    *   Added a collapsible "Image Processing Options" section to the UI, which appears only for the Webex backend, allowing users to override global settings on a per-request basis.
    *   Updated the backend logic in [`app.py`](app.py) and [`clients/webex_client_impl.py`](clients/webex_client_impl.py) to enforce these new rules.
*   **Bug Fixes & Hardening:**
    *   Resolved a critical timezone bug in [`static/script.js`](static/script.js) that caused incorrect date ranges to be sent to the backend.
    *   Fixed a caching flaw where the file-based cache was being used even when the user disabled caching in the UI.
    *   Addressed multiple `FPDFException` errors by implementing robust word-wrapping for long, unbreakable strings in the PDF generation logic.
    *   Reverted the PDF image embedding feature due to persistent rendering issues, ensuring the PDF download functionality remains stable and text-only.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Updated [`readme.md`](readme.md) to reflect the new configurable image processing feature.

### Key Accomplishments:

*   **Feature Finalization & Documentation:**
    *   **Webex Image Support:** Finalized and documented the application's ability to process and analyze images from Webex chats. The support includes downloading attachments, encoding them, and passing them to the multimodal AI model, which is now reflected in [`overview.md`](overview.md).
    *   **Caching Architecture:** Analyzed and documented the complete two-layer caching system in [`overview.md`](overview.md) and updated the [`project-plan.md`](project-plan.md) with future enhancements.
*   **Bug Fixes & Hardening:**
    *   Corrected a critical flaw in the in-memory cache ([`app.py`](app.py)) to prevent caching of data from the current day, ensuring data freshness.

### Key Accomplishments:

*   **Prompt Engineering**: Refined the system prompt in [`ai/prompts.py`](ai/prompts.py) to clarify how threaded conversations are handled, specifying that threads are replies to the immediately preceding message.
*   **Bug Fixes**:
    *   Corrected a bug in [`app.py`](app.py) where the conversation history was using the non-standard `model` role for the AI's responses. This has been changed to the standard `assistant` role for API compatibility.
    *   Fixed a logic error in [`ai/openai_compatible_llm.py`](ai/openai_compatible_llm.py) where the conversation history was being incorrectly merged into the system prompt instead of being passed as a proper message list. This ensures the model receives the correct conversational context.

# Last Session Summary (2025-07-27)

In these sessions, we completed a comprehensive overhaul of the user interface to enhance user experience, with a primary focus on dark mode improvements, mobile usability, and bug fixes.

### Key Accomplishments:

- **UI/UX Enhancements**:
    - Refactored the "Switch Service" feature into a dropdown and introduced a collapsible sidebar for desktop.
    - Developed a complete dark theme with a toggle switch, ensuring consistent dark mode experience across components.
    - Implemented a mobile-friendly sliding overlay menu and improved mobile UX by auto-closing the menu on chat start.
    - Added a checkbox to show/hide the "Optional: Start with a specific question" field.

- **Component & Library Upgrades**:
    - Replaced the `Tom-Select` library with `Choices.js` to fix dropdown styling and search functionality.
    - Replaced the `daterangepicker` date picker with `flatpickr` to address dark mode styling issues.

- **Bug Fixes**:
    - Resolved bugs causing the mobile menu button to misbehave and dropdowns to flash white on refresh, particularly in dark mode.
    - Fixed a regression where the "Start Chat" button was incorrectly enabled when no chat was selected.
    - Addressed backend behavior to send a proper response when no messages are found for a date range, preventing empty chat bubbles.
    - Corrected various dark theme styling inconsistencies for seamless UX.

# Last Session Summary (2025-07-24)

In this session, we implemented support for threaded conversations in Webex.

## Key Accomplishments:

*   **Grouped Messages by Thread ID**: We modified the `clients/webex_client_impl.py` file to group messages by `thread_id`.
*   **Formatted Threaded Messages for the LLM**: We modified the `app.py` file to format threaded messages for the LLM.
*   **Enhanced System Prompts**: We enhanced the system prompts to explain the new thread markers to the LLM.
*   **Updated Downloaded Artifacts**: We updated the download functionality to format the chat history with the same threaded structure.

# Last Session Summary (2025-07-23)

In this session, we implemented the incoming message handling for the Telegram bot and refactored the bot clients.

## Key Accomplishments:

*   **Implemented Telegram Bot**: We implemented the incoming message handling for the Telegram bot. This included creating a new webhook endpoint and a function to process commands from Telegram bots.
*   **Refactored Bot Clients**: We refactored the `WebexBotClient` and `TelegramBotClient` to use a factory pattern with a unified interface. This makes the code cleaner and easier to extend.
*   **Created `clients/bot_factory.py`**: A new file, `clients/bot_factory.py`, was created to house the bot factory and the `UnifiedBotClient` class.
*   **Updated `bot_manager.py`**: We updated the bot manager to support the new bot factory.
*   **Updated `example-config.json`**: We added a new section for Telegram bots to the example config file.
*   **Updated Frontend**: We made some minor updates to the frontend to support the new Telegram bot functionality.

## Next Steps:
*   Next we will work on project plan.
