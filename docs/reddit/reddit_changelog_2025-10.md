# Reddit Post Sorting & Filtering Improvements - Summary

## 🎯 What Was Changed

I've enhanced the Reddit integration with configurable post sorting, filtering, and rich metadata display. This gives you much better control over what posts are displayed and helps you identify relevant content quickly.

## ✅ Improvements Made

### 1. **Configurable Sorting Methods**
   - Support for 5 sorting algorithms: `hot`, `new`, `top`, `controversial`, `rising`
   - Previously: Always used "hot" sorting
   - Now: Choose your preferred default in config.json

### 2. **Time-Based Filtering**
   - For "top" and "controversial" sorts, filter by time period
   - Options: `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`, `all`
   - Useful for finding the best posts from specific timeframes

### 3. **Adjustable Limits**
   - Configure how many items to fetch for each category
   - `subreddit_limit`: Subscribed subreddits (default: 200)
   - `popular_posts_limit`: Posts from r/popular (default: 10)
   - `user_posts_limit`: Your own posts (default: 10)
   - `subreddit_posts_limit`: Posts when selecting a subreddit (default: 50)

### 4. **Rich Metadata Display**
   - Posts now show engagement metrics in the dropdown
   - Format: `Title [123⬆ 45💬 by u/author]`
   - Helps identify popular and active discussions at a glance

### 5. **Better Defaults**
   - All settings have sensible defaults
   - Backward compatible - existing configs work without changes
   - Your config now uses: "top" posts from the last "week"

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **`example-config.json`**
   - Added Reddit configuration section with all new parameters
   - Documented with clear comments

2. **`config.json`** (Your actual config)
   - Added configuration optimized for your use:
     - 15 popular posts (up from 10)
     - 75 subreddit posts (up from 50)
     - "top" sorting with "week" time filter
     - Displays best posts from the last 7 days

3. **`clients/reddit_client.py`**
   - Added `_fetch_posts_with_sort()` helper method
   - Enhanced `get_chats()` with metadata and configurable limits
   - Enhanced `get_posts_for_subreddit()` with sorting parameters
   - Added configuration loading in `__init__()`

4. **`docs/reddit_sorting_guide.md`** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive guide for the new features
   - Configuration examples for different use cases
   - Troubleshooting section
   - API reference

## 🚀 How to Use

### Your Current Configuration

Your `config.json` is now set to:
- Fetch **top posts from the last week**
- Show **75 posts** when you select a subreddit (50% more than before)
- Show **15 popular posts** (50% more than before)
- Display upvote scores, comment counts, and authors

### Trying Different Configurations

**Want the newest posts?**
```json
"default_sort": "new"
```

**Want daily top posts?**
```json
"default_sort": "top",
"default_time_filter": "day"
```

**Want controversial discussions?**
```json
"default_sort": "controversial",
"default_time_filter": "week"
```

**Want more or fewer posts?**
```json
"subreddit_posts_limit": 100  // Change to any number
```

## 📊 Example Output

### Before
```
Popular: Some interesting post title
My Post: My recent post
```

### After
```
Popular: Some interesting post title [1247⬆ 345💬]
My Post: My recent post [42⬆ 12💬 by u/yourname]
```

Now you can immediately see:
- Which posts are most popular (upvotes)
- Which posts have active discussions (comments)
- Who authored the post

## 🎁 Benefits

1. **Better Discovery**: Find the most relevant posts for your analysis
2. **Time Savings**: Quickly identify high-engagement posts
3. **Flexibility**: Adjust settings for different subreddits and use cases
4. **Context**: Rich metadata helps you make informed choices
5. **Performance**: Tune limits based on your needs

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

- **Cleaner Code**: Reusable `_fetch_posts_with_sort()` method
- **Type Hints**: Better IDE support and code clarity
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for invalid sort methods
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing setups work without changes

## 📖 Next Steps

1. **Try It Out**: Restart your app and select a subreddit in Reddit mode
2. **Experiment**: Try different `default_sort` and `default_time_filter` values
3. **Tune Limits**: Adjust post limits based on your preferences
4. **Read the Guide**: See `docs/reddit_sorting_guide.md` for advanced usage

## 💡 Future Enhancement Ideas

If you want to take this further, consider:
- UI controls to change sort method without editing config
- Per-subreddit sort preferences saved in localStorage
- Advanced filters (minimum score, minimum comments)
- Custom sorting by engagement ratio (comments/upvotes)
- Saved sorting presets for quick switching

- ✅ Different sort methods work correctly
- ✅ Time filters work for "top" and "controversial"
- ✅ Limits are respected for all post categories
