## 🛠️ Configuration Tuning

### Minimal Favorites (Quick Load)
```json
"favorites_limit": 10
```
Only fetch first 10 favorites.

### Maximum Favorites (Comprehensive)
```json
"favorites_limit": 100
```
Fetch up to 100 favorites.

### Disable When Not Needed
```json
"show_favorites": false
```
Use regular subscribed subreddits only.

"show_favorites": true
```

**Result:**
```
⭐ Most popular favorites first
⭐ Less popular favorites
Regular subs by popularity (not alphabet - same sort applies)
```

*Note: Both sections use the same sort method. For different sorting per section, that would be a future enhancement.*

### Activity-Based (See What's Hot Now)
```json
"subreddit_sort": "activity",
"show_favorites": true
```

**Result:**
```
⭐ Most active favorites right now
⭐ Less active favorites
Most active regular subs
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Favorite Strategically
- Mark 5-10 most important subreddits as favorites
- Use for work, research, or main interests
- Don't favorite everything (defeats the purpose)

### 2. Combine with Sorting
- Use `"subscribers"` for popular communities first
- Use `"alphabetical"` for easy lookup
- Use `"activity"` for trending topics

### 3. Adjust Limits
- More favorites? Increase `favorites_limit`
- Faster loading? Decrease limits
- Find your sweet spot!

### 4. Regular Maintenance
- Update favorites on Reddit as interests change
- Remove old favorites you don't need anymore
- Keep the list focused and useful
