## 🎨 Member Count Formatting

### Automatic Formatting Based on Size

| Actual Subscribers | Display Format |
|-------------------|----------------|
| 45,234,567 | `45.2M members` |
| 2,543,123 | `2.5M members` |
| 456,789 | `456.7K members` |
| 12,345 | `12.3K members` |
| 847 | `847 members` |

This makes it easy to understand at a glance:
- **M = Millions**: Major subreddits
- **K = Thousands**: Medium-sized communities
- **Plain number**: Small/niche communities

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Switch sorting based on task
- **Content analysis?** → Use `subscribers` (find popular topics)
- **Systematic research?** → Use `alphabetical` (organized approach)
- **Trending topics?** → Use `activity` (what's hot now)

### Tip 2: Use member counts to gauge sample size
- **>1M members**: Major subreddit, diverse opinions
- **100K-1M**: Established community, active discussions
- **10K-100K**: Niche community, focused topics
- **<10K**: Small community, specialized content

### Tip 3: Combine with post filtering
```json
"subreddit_sort": "subscribers",    // Popular subreddits first
"default_sort": "top",              // Top posts from those
"default_time_filter": "week"       // From this week
```
Result: Best content from your biggest communities!
