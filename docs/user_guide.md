## Logging In

1.  Upon opening the app, you will see the login screen.
2.  Select **Telegram**, **Webex**, or **Reddit** from the "Chat Service" dropdown.
3.  **For Telegram**:
    -   Enter your full phone number, including the country code (e.g., `+14155552671`).
    -   Click "Send Code".
    -   Enter the code you receive in your Telegram app. If you have 2-Factor Authentication enabled, you will also be prompted for your password.
4.  **For Webex & Reddit**:
    -   Click the "Login with..." button.
    -   You will be redirected to the official service login page. Sign in with your credentials.
    -   Grant the application permission to access your account.
    -   You will be automatically redirected back to the app, now logged in.

## Analyzing a Chat

Once logged in, you will be on the "Analyze Chats" screen.

1.  **Select a Chat**: Your chats, rooms, or posts will be listed in the searchable dropdown. If the list is empty, click the **"Refresh List"** link to load them. See the platform-specific notes below for details.
2.  **Select an AI Model**: Choose your preferred AI model from the list. A sensible default will be pre-selected if configured.
3.  **Select a Date Range**: Use the date picker to choose the start and end dates. You can also select from pre-defined ranges like "Last 2 Days", "Last Week", etc. Date ranges are interpreted using your browserâ€™s IANA timezone (Local-Day semantics).
4.  **Configure Caching**: Use the "Enable caching for faster analysis" checkbox to enable or disable caching for the current analysis.
5.  **Configure Image Processing**: Globally toggle image analysis and set a maximum image size (MB); applies to all providers.
6.  **(Optional) Start with a Specific Question**: Before starting the chat, you can enter a specific question in the text box. If you do, the AI will answer that question directly instead of providing a general summary.
7.  **Start Chat**: Click the **"Start Chat"** button to begin the analysis and open the conversational chat window.
8.  **Stop Generation**: While the AI is generating a response, the "Send" button will turn into a red "Stop" button. Click it at any time to cancel the current analysis.
9.  **Ask Follow-up Questions**: Use the chat input to ask follow-up questions about the analyzed data.
10. **Clear & Start New**: Click the **"Clear & Start New"** button to clear the conversation and start a new analysis.
11. **Download Results**: Use the Download menu to export:
    - Text (.txt): text-only.
    - PDF (.pdf): includes embedded images.
    - HTML (.html): images embedded inline via data URIs.
    - ZIP (.zip): transcript.txt, transcript_with_images.html referencing images/, images files, and manifest.json metadata.

### Using Recent Chats

Below the main controls, you will find a "Recent Chats" list. This feature helps you quickly return to previous analysis sessions.

-   **Backend Specific**: The list is specific to the currently selected backend (Telegram or Webex).
-   **Restore Session**: Clicking on a chat name will instantly restore all the settings from that session, including the AI model, date range, and any specific question you asked. You can then modify these settings or click "Start Chat".
-   **Quick Start**: Clicking the **"Go"** button next to a chat name will restore the session settings *and* immediately start the analysis, taking you directly to the chat window.

### Platform-Specific Chat Selection & Threading

-   **Telegram & Webex**: The dropdown will show a list of your chats and rooms. The analyzer will automatically reconstruct reply chains to provide accurate conversational context to the AI.
-   **Reddit**: The Reddit backend offers two distinct, streamlined workflows, which you can switch between using the "Select a Workflow" radio buttons:
    -   **Analyze a Subreddit**: This workflow allows you to perform a deep analysis of a specific post and its entire comment tree. First, select a subreddit from the "Select a Chat" dropdown (which contains your subscribed subreddits, popular posts, and your own posts). Then, select a specific post from the "Select a Post" dropdown that appears.
    -   **Summarize from URL**: This workflow allows you to quickly get a summary of any Reddit post. Simply paste the post's URL into the "Paste a Reddit Post URL" text box.
    
    In both workflows, the analysis is started by clicking the main **"Start Chat"** button. The analyzer will then fetch the post and its entire comment tree, correctly indenting all nested replies to preserve the thread structure. It will also fetch any images from the post or comments if image processing is enabled.

## Using the Bots

After registering a bot via the **"Manage Bots"** UI, you can interact with it directly in its respective chat application.

**Important**: For bots to receive messages from Webex or Telegram, your application must be accessible from the public internet. If running locally, you must use a tunneling service like **ngrok**.
1.  Start ngrok: `ngrok http 8000`
2.  Copy the public HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://abcdef123.ngrok.io`).
3.  Use this URL in the "Public Webhook URL" field when registering your bot in the UI. The application will set the webhook for you automatically.

### Webex Bot Usage
-   **Interaction**: Mention the bot in any space it has been added to.
-   **Example**: `@YourBotName summarize last 2 days`
-   **For more details, see the [Webex Bot Guide](webex_bot_guide.md)**.

### Telegram Bot Usage
-   **Interaction**: By default, the bot is in "Summarizer" mode. Send it a message in a private chat or a group it belongs to.
-   **Example**: `summarize last 3 days`
-   **Conversational AI Mode**: Send the `/aimode` command to toggle the bot into a conversational assistant. It will remember the context of your conversation. Send `/aimode` again to switch back to summarizer mode and clear the conversation history.
-   **For more details, see the [Telegram Bot Guide](telegram_bot_guide.md)**.

## Switching Services & Logging Out

-   **Switching**: You can be logged into Telegram, Webex, and Reddit simultaneously. Use the **"Switch Service"** button to toggle between them.
-   **Logout**: Clicking **"Logout"** will sign you out of the currently active service. If you are logged into any other service, the app will switch to one of them; otherwise, it will return to the main login screen.
