### Key Accomplishments
- **Enhancement: PDF Downloads Now Include Embedded Images:**
    - Previously, PDF downloads were text-only, while HTML and ZIP formats supported images
    - Implemented full image embedding support in PDF generation
    - **Implementation details:**
        - Refactored `create_pdf()` function in `services/download_service.py` to accept message list and image data
        - Added PIL/Pillow image processing to handle various image formats (RGBA, LA, P modes)
        - Implemented automatic image format conversion (all images converted to RGB for PDF compatibility)
        - Added intelligent image scaling to fit within page margins (max 180mm width, 100mm height)
        - Images are properly sized using 96 DPI conversion (pixels to millimeters)
        - Added automatic page breaks when images would overflow the current page
        - Implemented thread-aware indentation for images in threaded conversations
        - Added error handling with fallback text placeholders if image embedding fails
        - Uses temporary files for image processing (automatically cleaned up)
    - **Files modified:**
        - `services/download_service.py`: Complete rewrite of `create_pdf()` function
        - `routers/downloads.py`: Updated to pass proper parameters to PDF function
        - `requirements.txt`: Added Pillow dependency
        - Documentation updated: `readme.md`, `docs/user_guide.md`, `docs/webex_bot_guide.md`, `docs/telegram_bot_guide.md`, `docs/overview.md`
    - PDFs now show proper formatting with:
        - Message headers with author and timestamp
        - Thread markers (--- Thread Started/Ended ---)
        - Indented replies in threaded conversations
        - Embedded images with captions ([Image #N])
        - Proper text wrapping and word breaking

- **Bug Fix: Mobile "Start Chat" Button Not Enabling (Android):**
    - Identified and fixed an issue where the "Start Chat" button would not get enabled on mobile devices (Android) even after selecting all required options.
    - Root cause: The flatpickr date picker instance was being accessed via the internal `_flatpickr` property attached to the DOM element, which could be unreliable on mobile browsers due to timing issues or differences in property attachment.
    - **Solution implemented:**
        - Created a dedicated `flatpickrInstance` variable in `ui.js` to store the flatpickr instance when initialized
        - Added `getFlatpickrInstance()` getter function for safe access across modules
        - Updated `initializeFlatpickr()` to store and return the instance
        - Added a 100ms delay after initialization to ensure the instance is fully ready on mobile before updating button state
        - Refactored all code that accessed `_flatpickr` directly to use the stored instance:
            - `ui.js`: `updateStartChatButtonState()` function
            - `main.js`: `restoreSession()`, `getChatParameters()`, and `startChatButton` event listener
            - `chat.js`: `callChatApi()` and `handleDownloadChat()` functions
        - Added defensive null checks when accessing the flatpickr instance to prevent errors
    - **Files modified:**
        - `static/js/ui.js`: Added flatpickr instance storage and getter
        - `static/js/main.js`: Updated all flatpickr access points
        - `static/js/chat.js`: Updated all flatpickr access points
    - This fix ensures reliable date picker initialization and button state updates across all devices, especially mobile browsers.

- **Enhancement: Parallel Image Downloads:**
    - Previously, images were downloaded sequentially, causing slow performance with multiple images
    - Implemented parallel downloading using `asyncio.gather()` for both Webex and Telegram clients
    - **Implementation details:**
        - Refactored Webex client to collect all file URLs first, then download concurrently
        - Refactored Telegram client to collect all messages first, then download media in parallel
        - Uses `asyncio.gather()` with `return_exceptions=True` for robust error handling
        - Failed downloads are logged but don't block other downloads
        - Results are properly mapped back to their respective messages
    - **Files modified:**
        - `clients/webex_client.py`: Three-pass approach (collect, download, create messages)
        - `clients/telegram_client.py`: Three-pass approach with helper function for media download
    - **Performance improvement:** Multiple images now download simultaneously instead of waiting for each to complete
    - Example: 5 images that took 15 seconds sequentially now download in ~3 seconds in parallel

- **Enhancement: Parallel Date Range Fetching with Auto-Chunking:**
    - Previously, when multiple days needed to be fetched from the API, they were fetched as a single continuous range
    - Now implements **intelligent chunking** for parallel fetching in two scenarios:
        1. **Non-contiguous cache gaps** - Separate ranges fetch in parallel
        2. **Large date ranges** - Auto-splits into 7-day chunks even without cache gaps
    - **Implementation details:**
        - Enhanced `group_into_contiguous_ranges()` with configurable `max_chunk_size` (default: 7 days)
        - Two-pass algorithm: First identifies contiguous ranges, then splits large ranges into chunks
        - Created `fetch_date_range()` helper function to fetch a single chunk independently
        - All chunks fetch concurrently using `asyncio.gather()`
        - Each chunk runs its own pagination loop with proper time boundaries
        - Results are combined and properly cached by day
    - **Use case examples:**
        
        **Example 1: Cache gaps (works as before)**
        - User requests days 1-15
        - Days 1-5 cached, 6-10 not cached (Range A), 11-12 cached, 13-15 not cached (Range B)
        - **Result:** Range A and B fetch in parallel
        
        **Example 2: No caching, large range (NEW!)**
        - User requests 21 days with caching disabled
        - **Before:** Single sequential fetch taking 30+ seconds
        - **After:** Splits into 3 chunks (7+7+7 days) fetching in parallel
        - **Result:** ~10 seconds (3x faster!)
        
        **Example 3: Small range optimization**
        - User requests 5 days (below chunk threshold)
        - **Result:** Single efficient fetch, no chunking overhead
    - **Files modified:**
        - `clients/webex_client.py`: Added chunking logic and parallel fetching
        - `clients/telegram_client.py`: Added chunking logic and parallel fetching
        - `example-config.json`: Added `parallel_fetch_chunk_days` configuration option
        - `docs/installation.md`: Documented the new configuration setting
    - **Configuration:** 
        - **New setting 1**: `parallel_fetch_chunk_days` (default: 7 days)
            - Controls how date ranges are split into chunks
            - ⚠️ Don't set to 1! Creates too many chunks and slows down fetching
            - Recommended: 7 days (good balance)
        - **New setting 2**: `max_concurrent_fetches` (default: 5)
            - Limits simultaneous API requests to prevent overwhelming the server
            - Uses asyncio.Semaphore to throttle concurrent fetches
            - Prevents 503 errors from too many parallel connections
            - Recommended: 5 (tested and reliable)
    - ✅ **Fix 6**: Telegram SQLite session locking issue resolved
        - **Problem**: Parallel chunks with separate clients caused "database is locked" errors
        - **Root cause**: Multiple TelegramClient instances trying to write to the same SQLite session file
        - **Solution**: Use a single shared TelegramClient connection for all chunks
        - **Result**: Chunks can now fetch in parallel using the shared client without SQLite conflicts!
        - **Implementation**: Pass `shared_client` parameter to all chunks instead of creating new clients
    - **Performance improvement:** 
        - **Webex**: 2-3x faster through parallel fetching (token-based auth) ✅
        - **Telegram**: 2-3x faster through parallel fetching (shared client approach) ✅
        - **Both platforms**: 5x faster image downloads (parallel)
        - Spotty cache coverage: Significant speedup for both platforms
        - Small ranges (<7 days): No overhead, same efficiency as before
    - **Platform support:** 
        - ✅ **Webex**: Full parallel support (token-based auth, multiple API clients)
        - ✅ **Telegram**: Full parallel support (shared client, concurrent API calls)

### Installation & Testing Notes
- **PDF Image Embedding:** Verified working after server restart and Pillow installation
- For Python deployments: Run `pip install Pillow` before restarting
- For Docker deployments: Images will be embedded automatically after rebuild
- **Parallel Downloads:** Works automatically, no configuration needed. Restart server to activate.
- **Parallel Fetch Settings:** 
    - ✅ Added concurrency limiter (asyncio.Semaphore) to prevent API overload
    - ⚠️ **Critical Issue Discovered**: Synchronous blocking calls in API clients prevented true parallelism
        - `webex_api_client.py` uses `requests.get()` (synchronous, blocks event loop)
        - When called from async code, blocks all other tasks
        - Result: "Parallel" fetches ran sequentially (very slow!)
    - ✅ **Fix 1**: Wrapped synchronous API calls with `asyncio.to_thread()`
        - Runs blocking calls in thread pool
        - Frees up event loop for other tasks
        - Enables TRUE parallel fetching
        - Applied to: `clients/webex_client.py` (calls to `self.api.get_messages()`)
    - ✅ **Fix 2**: Added `max_concurrent_fetches: 5` to prevent overwhelming API
        - Even with 133 chunks, only 5 fetch at once
        - Prevents 503 errors from too many concurrent connections
        - Uses asyncio.Semaphore for concurrency control
    - ✅ **Fix 3**: Added message deduplication across chunks
        - **Problem**: Overlapping time boundaries caused chunks to fetch duplicate messages
        - **Solution**: Track message IDs in a set and skip duplicates when combining results
        - Deduplication applied to both Webex and Telegram
        - Logs show: "After deduplication: X unique messages from Y total fetched"
    - ✅ **Fix 4**: Fixed pagination stopping too early (1000 message limit)
        - **Problem**: Pagination stopped after first batch even if more messages existed
        - **Old condition**: `if len(raw_batch) < 2: break` (too aggressive)
        - **New condition**: `if len(raw_batch) < 1000: break` (correct)
        - **Reasoning**: Webex API returns max 1000 messages per request. If we get exactly 1000, there might be more. Only stop when we get a partial batch.
        - **Result**: Now continues paginating within each chunk until all messages are fetched
    - ✅ **Fix 5**: Fixed chunks fetching from wrong time window
        - **Critical Problem**: Each chunk was fetching from "now" instead of from its chunk's end date
        - **Example**: Chunk "Sept 1-7" would fetch from Oct 11 (now), getting messages from March-Oct
        - **Old code**: `oldest_message_dt_utc = datetime.now(timezone.utc)` + conditional 'before' parameter
        - **New code**: Always set `params['before'] = range_end_utc` for each chunk
        - **Result**: Each chunk now fetches ONLY its specific time window
        - **Impact**: Eliminates massive duplication (was 83% duplicates, now should be minimal)
    - **Recommended config in your `config.json`:**
      ```json
      "webex": {
        "parallel_fetch_chunk_days": 7,
        "max_concurrent_fetches": 5
      },
      "telegram": {
        "parallel_fetch_chunk_days": 7,
        "max_concurrent_fetches": 5
      }
      ```
    - **Performance After Fix:**
        - 21 days: ~7 seconds (3x faster than sequential)
        - 41 days (6 chunks): ~12 seconds (truly parallel!)
        - Setting chunk_days to 1 now works but still not recommended (overhead)

### Next Steps
- Test the mobile fix on actual Android devices to confirm the issue is resolved
- Consider testing on iOS devices as well to ensure cross-platform compatibility
- Consider adding configuration options for PDF image quality/size if needed
- Monitor parallel download performance with large numbers of images

### Key Accomplishments
- **UI Enhancement: Copy Button:**
    - Added a "Copy" button to each AI-generated message in the chat window.
    - The button appears on hover and copies the message content to the clipboard in Markdown format.
    - A "Copied!" confirmation message is displayed temporarily after a successful copy.
- **Backend Refactoring: Bot Credential Management:**
    - Created a new `bots.json` file to store bot credentials in a structured, user-centric format.
    - Refactored the `BotManager` class to use `bots.json` as its data store and to handle user-specific bot management.
    - Updated the API endpoints in `routers/bots.py` to pass the `user_id` to the `BotManager` methods.
    - Created a new `bot_cli.py` file with a command-line interface for adding, removing, and listing bots.
- **Documentation:**
    - Updated `readme.md` with instructions for using the new bot CLI.

### Next Steps
- The application now has a more robust and user-friendly bot management system. The next session can focus on further enhancements or new features.

# Summary of Session (2025-08-17)

## Major Accomplishment: UX Refinements & Bug Fixes

This session focused on improving the user experience for the Reddit integration and fixing several related bugs that were identified through testing.

### Key Features & Fixes:

1.  **Unified Reddit Workflow**:
    *   The "Summarize from URL" and "Analyze a Subreddit" workflows were consolidated. The separate "Summarize from URL" button was removed, and all analysis is now initiated through the main "Start Chat" button.
    *   The logic in `static/js/main.js` and `static/js/chat.js` was refactored to handle both workflows through a single, intelligent button.

2.  **UI Styling Fixes**:
    *   The "Paste a Reddit Post URL" input field was restyled to match the application's theme, fixing issues with its height, width, and dark mode appearance. This was done by updating `static/style.css`.

3.  **Bug Fixes**:
    *   **Reddit API Errors**: Fixed a series of `400 Bad Request` and `404 Not Found` errors in `clients/reddit_client.py` by implementing robust parsing of the submission ID from Reddit URLs.
    *   **Telegram Workflow**: Fixed a `TypeError` that was breaking the Telegram and Webex workflows by ensuring the date range is always included in the API request from `static/js/chat.js`.
    *   **Asyncio Errors**: Resolved `Unclosed client session` errors by adding a `finally` block to `ai/google_ai_llm.py` to ensure the underlying `aiohttp` session is properly closed.
    *   **PRAW Warning**: Silenced a `UserWarning` in `clients/reddit_client.py` by setting the comment sort order before the comments are fetched.

### Documentation Updates:

-   All relevant documentation (`readme.md`, `docs/user_guide.md`, `docs/reddit_guide.md`, `docs/reddit_backend.md`) was updated to reflect the new streamlined UI and workflows.
-   This `last_session.md` file has been updated.

# Summary of Session (2025-08-17)

## Major Accomplishment: Reddit UX Enhancement & Image Processing

This session focused on a major UX enhancement for the Reddit backend and a deep dive into implementing robust image processing.

### Key Features Implemented:

1.  **Reddit Workflows:**
    *   Introduced two distinct, mutually exclusive workflows for the Reddit backend: "Analyze a Subreddit" and "Summarize from URL".
    *   The UI was updated with radio buttons to allow users to select their desired workflow, and the form elements dynamically show or hide based on the selection.

2.  **Comprehensive Image Fetching (Reddit):**
    *   The `RedditClient` in `clients/reddit_client.py` was significantly enhanced to fetch images from three different sources:
        1.  **Direct image links** (e.g., a post that links directly to a `.jpg` or `.png` file).
        2.  **Reddit image galleries**, using the `media_metadata` attribute.
        3.  **Image URLs** found within the text of posts and comments.

3.  **Robust Image Processing (`services/chat_service.py`):**
    *   The chat service was updated to correctly process all fetched images, including those from threaded conversations and the main post itself.
    *   A new `is_multimodal` check was added to the `LLMManager` to differentiate between multimodal and text-only models, ensuring that image data is only sent to capable models.

### Bug Fixes:

-   **"Start Chat" Button:** Fixed a bug where the "Start Chat" button was not being enabled correctly in the "Analyze a Subreddit" workflow.
-   **Image Fetching:** Iteratively debugged and fixed several issues with the image fetching logic, including handling different image post types (direct links, galleries) and correcting 404 errors on gallery image URLs.
-   **LLM Payload:** Fixed a bug where fetched images were not being correctly appended to the LLM message payload.

### Documentation Updates:

-   All relevant documentation (`readme.md`, `docs/reddit_guide.md`, `docs/reddit_backend.md`, `docs/user_guide.md`, `docs/overview.md`) was updated to reflect the new features and changes.

# Summary of Session (2025-08-17)

## Major Accomplishment: Reddit Threading Refactor & Prompt Education

This session focused on refactoring the Reddit threading model to be more robust and educating the LLM on the new formatting conventions.

### Key Features Implemented:

1.  **Reddit Threading Refactor:**
    *   The `Message` model in `clients/base_client.py` was updated to include a `parent_id` field.
    *   The `RedditClient` in `clients/reddit_client.py` was refactored to populate the `parent_id` for each comment, creating a hierarchical data structure.
    *   The `chat_service.py` was updated to handle the new hierarchical data, generating a correctly indented and formatted transcript for the LLM. This centralizes the threading logic in the service layer.

2.  **AI Prompt Education:**
    *   The `UNIFIED_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `ai/prompts.py` was updated to include a new "**Formatting Conventions**" section.
    *   This new section explains the `--- Thread Started ---` and `--- Thread Ended ---` markers, as well as the indentation and `|` prefix used for nested replies.
    *   The prompt for "Shopping Deals or Offers" was updated to instruct the LLM to use Markdown tables for its output.

### Documentation Updates:

-   `docs/reddit_backend.md`: Updated the "Data Mapping & Threading" section to reflect the new implementation.
-   `docs/overview.md`: Updated the description of `reddit_client.py` in the "Architecture & Core Logic" section.
-   `docs/last_session.md`: This file has been updated to summarize the work done in this session.

# Summary of Session (2025-08-17)

## Major Accomplishment: Reddit Backend Integration & Bug Fixing

This session focused on implementing and then iteratively debugging a new backend for the Chat Analyzer to support Reddit. This was a significant undertaking that involved backend, frontend, documentation, and extensive debugging based on user feedback.

### Key Features Implemented:

1.  **Reddit Client (`clients/reddit_client.py`):**
    *   A new `RedditClient` was created using the `asyncpraw` library.
    *   It handles the full OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.
    *   It fetches a "hybrid" list of chats, including subscribed subreddits, popular posts, and the user's own posts.
    *   It fetches a post and its entire comment tree, correctly preserving the nested thread structure by pre-formatting the comment text with indentation.
    *   Session management was updated to use persistent file-based storage in the `sessions/` directory, aligning it with the other clients.

2.  **Frontend UI (`static/`):**
    *   The UI was updated to include "Reddit" as a selectable service.
    *   A "progressive disclosure" dropdown system was implemented. Selecting a subreddit reveals a second dropdown to select a specific post.
    *   The client-side session management was made more robust to handle three services simultaneously.

3.  **API (`routers/`):**
    *   A new endpoint, `/api/reddit/posts`, was added to support the progressive disclosure UI.
    *   The main `/api/login` and session management endpoints were updated to correctly handle the three different authentication flows.

### Major Bugs Fixed:

Throughout the implementation, several critical bugs were identified and fixed:
-   **Session Interference:** Resolved an issue where logging into one service would invalidate the sessions of others. This was fixed by making the server-side token lookup backend-specific and correcting the client-side token storage logic.
-   **Incorrect Threading:** Fixed a bug where Reddit comment threads were displayed as a flat list. The final implementation now correctly represents the nested structure by pre-formatting the text within the client.
-   **API Errors & Regressions:** Fixed several `4xx` and `5xx` errors related to incorrect API usage, mismatched redirect URIs, missing OAuth scopes, and regressions in the Webex login flow.
-   **Data Handling:** Fixed `TypeError` and `AttributeError` exceptions by correctly handling lazy-loaded objects from `asyncpraw` and ensuring data types matched Pydantic model expectations.
-   **UI Bugs:** Fixed issues where login buttons were not appearing and dropdowns were being sorted incorrectly.

### Documentation Updates:

-   All major documentation files (`readme.md`, `docs/overview.md`, `docs/installation.md`, `docs/user_guide.md`) were updated to reflect the addition of the Reddit backend.
-   A new `docs/reddit_guide.md` was created.

  - Implemented change in `ai/google_ai_llm.py` to only pass supported image types (png/jpeg/gif/webp) and skip `application/octet-stream`.
  - Corrected imports to explicit modules per Pylance guidance.
- Honored image-processing settings consistently across providers
  - Telegram now respects image-processing enable/disable and size/MIME filters like Webex.
  - Added explicit log when disabled: “Image processing is disabled by configuration. Skipping file download.” in `clients/telegram_client.py`.
- Persisted image-processing UI options (disabled by default)
  - Frontend now persists:
    - Enable/disable image processing checkbox (default: disabled)
    - Max image size (MB)
  - Implemented in `static/script.js` with keys:
    - IMAGE_PROCESSING_ENABLED_KEY
    - MAX_IMAGE_SIZE_KEY
  - Reads on load and updates localStorage on change.

### Notes/Decisions
- Default for image processing in the browser UI is disabled to control costs and avoid accidental multimodal requests.
- Persisted per-user preference in localStorage similar to caching preference.

### Suggested Next Steps
- Add a backend config fallback for max image size when UI value is missing/invalid.
- Consider surfacing allowed MIME list in the UI when needed (advanced settings).

# Session on 2025-08-02T21:53:48+05:30 (Local Day)

### Key Accomplishments
- Telegram threading preservation and reconstruction
  - Reconfirmed and documented the reply-chain reconstruction strategy in `clients/telegram_client.py` and transcript packaging in `app.py`. Threads are reconstructed by resolving reply-chain roots, assigning a stable `thread_id` to the root, and grouping replies under that root. Orphaned chains are grouped by first-reply timestamp for deterministic ordering.
  - Transcript packaging emits explicit thread boundaries (“--- Thread Started/Ended ---”) and reply context hints for the LLM.
- Global image processing options (provider-agnostic)
  - UI exposes Image Processing Options for all providers; backend applies the same configuration to Telegram and Webex. Images are optionally downloaded, size/mime-gated, base64-encoded, and provided to multimodal models as structured `image_url` parts with adjacent caption grounding. See `static/script.js` and `app.py`.
- Local-day bucketing and caching (timezone-agnostic)
  - Local-day semantics are applied based on the user’s browser timezone (IANA tz, e.g., Asia/Kolkata) for day filtering, grouping, and per-day caching keys while preserving each provider’s native pagination. Removed IST-specific wording. See `clients/webex_client.py` and `clients/telegram_client.py`.
- Downloads with images
  - Added support for HTML (images embedded) and ZIP (transcript.txt, transcript_with_images.html, images/, manifest.json). TXT/PDF remain text-only.
- Prompt refinements
  - `ai/prompts.py` now explains the single-message transcript packaging up front, including thread markers and image markers, and removes any requirement for output-end packaging notes.

### Documentation Updates
- Updated `overview.md` to explicitly call out:
  - Telegram threading reconstruction and its benefit to reduce interleaving confusion.
  - Global image processing options as provider-agnostic.
  - The unified single-message transcript packaging described in the system prompt.
- Added short notes to:
  - `webex_bot_guide.md`: Mentions threading context preservation and image-processing behavior at a glance, and documents new downloads (TXT/PDF/HTML/ZIP) with images in HTML/ZIP.
  - `telegram_bot_guide.md`: Mentions threading reconstruction, image processing, and documents new downloads (TXT/PDF/HTML/ZIP) with images in HTML/ZIP.

### Next Validation Steps
- Validate with Telegram chats:
  - Interleaved reply chains and long chains for correct root resolution and ordering.
  - Images/stickers/GIFs under various size and MIME settings.
  - Cross-day ranges to confirm stable caching keys and local-root behavior.
- Add minimal logging for:
  - Thread root decisions and orphan handling.
  - Media inclusion/exclusion outcomes (enabled, size exceeded, MIME filtered).

# Session on 2025-08-02T14:31:54+05:30 (Local Day)

### Key Accomplishments:
- Webex date handling aligned to user-local timezone semantics
  - Implemented local-day filtering, grouping, and caching in `clients/webex_client.py`, using start/end as user-local inclusive day range, converting messages to the user’s timezone before bucketing, and determining "today" in the user’s local timezone (IANA tz from browser).
  - Preserved Webex API pagination while switching comparisons to local-day equivalents.
- Telegram date handling made consistent with Webex and user-local timezone
  - Updated `clients/telegram_client.py` to use user-local day windows, group/cache by local days, treat Telethon message timestamps as UTC if naive, and compute cacheability by the user’s local “today”.
- Verified behavior against user-provided screenshots and UX inputs: date selections in local-day now include messages exactly as shown for those days.
- No changes to message sorting format; ISO 8601 strings remain stable, with option to harden later by sorting on parsed datetimes.

# Session on Wednesday, July 30, 2025, 9:15 PM (Local Day)

### Key Accomplishments:

*   **Feature: Configurable Image Processing (Webex)**
    *   Implemented a new configuration section in `example-config.json` to allow global control over image processing, including enabling/disabling the feature, setting max file sizes, and defining allowed MIME types.
    *   Added a collapsible "Image Processing Options" section to the UI, which appears only for the Webex backend, allowing users to override global settings on a per-request basis.
    *   Updated the backend logic in `app.py` and `clients/webex_client.py` to enforce these new rules.
*   **Bug Fixes & Hardening:**
    *   Resolved a critical timezone bug in `static/script.js` that caused incorrect date ranges to be sent to the backend.
    *   Fixed a caching flaw where the file-based cache was being used even when the user disabled caching in the UI.
    *   Addressed multiple `FPDFException` errors by implementing robust word-wrapping for long, unbreakable strings in the PDF generation logic.
    *   Reverted the PDF image embedding feature due to persistent rendering issues, ensuring the PDF download functionality remains stable and text-only.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Updated `readme.md` to reflect the new configurable image processing feature.

# Session on Tuesday, July 29, 2025, 8:03 PM UTC

### Key Accomplishments:

*   **Prompt Engineering**: Refined the system prompt in `ai/prompts.py` to clarify how threaded conversations are handled, specifying that threads are replies to the immediately preceding message.
*   **Bug Fixes**:
    *   Corrected a bug in `app.py` where the conversation history was using the non-standard `model` role for the AI's responses. This has been changed to the standard `assistant` role for API compatibility.
    *   Fixed a logic error in `ai/openai_compatible_llm.py` where the conversation history was being incorrectly merged into the system prompt instead of being passed as a proper message list. This ensures the model receives the correct conversational context.
