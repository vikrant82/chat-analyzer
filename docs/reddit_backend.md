# Reddit Backend Integration: Final Implementation Summary

**Document Version:** 3.0 (As-Built)
**Date:** 2025-08-17

## 1. Project Goal & Philosophy

The primary objective was to integrate Reddit as a new, fully-featured backend for the Chat Analyzer application. This involved adapting Reddit's non-traditional, post-and-comment-based structure into the application's existing chat-centric data model.

The guiding philosophy was **"Adaptation at the Edge."** All Reddit-specific logic was successfully confined to the new `RedditClient`, leaving the core application services untouched and ensuring the integration is clean, decoupled, and maintainable.

## 2. Technical Research & Key Decisions

-   **Primary Library:** We selected **`Async PRAW`**, the official asynchronous version of the Python Reddit API Wrapper. This was a critical decision to ensure non-blocking I/O within the application's `asyncio` event loop.
-   **OAuth Scopes:** Through an iterative process, the required OAuth scopes were determined to be `identity`, `read`, `history`, `subscribe`, `vote`, and `mysubreddits`. The `mysubreddits` scope was essential for fetching the list of a user's subscribed communities.

## 3. Data Mapping & Threading (Final Implementation)

The core challenge was mapping Reddit's nested structure to the application's simpler, one-level threading model. The final implementation handles all complexity within the `RedditClient`.

-   **`Chat` -> Hybrid Object:** The `Chat` model is used to represent three different concepts in the UI dropdown:
    -   **Subreddits:** Have an ID prefixed with `sub_` (e.g., `sub_selfhosted`) to be identifiable on the frontend.
    -   **Popular Posts:** Fetched from r/popular.
    -   **User's Posts:** Fetched from the authenticated user's profile.

-   **`Message` -> Post & Comment Tree with Parent IDs:**
    -   **The Post:** Becomes the first `Message` in the list with `thread_id: None` and `parent_id: None`.
    -   **The Comments:** The `get_messages` method in the `RedditClient` performs a full in-memory traversal of the comment tree. It populates the `parent_id` for each comment, which is the ID of the comment it is replying to.
    -   **Grouping:** The `thread_id` for all comments is set to the submission's ID. The `chat_service` now uses the `parent_id` field to reconstruct the comment tree and generate the correctly indented output. This centralizes the threading logic in the service layer.
    -   **Image Fetching:** The `RedditClient` now uses a dedicated `ImageFetcher` class to handle the complex logic of fetching images from direct links, galleries, and inline URLs.

-   **`User` -> Redditor:** A direct mapping. `getattr` is used for safe access to attributes like `id` and `name` to prevent errors from deleted users.

## 4. Authentication & Session Management

-   **Mechanism:** Standard OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant flow.
-   **Redirect URI:** The required redirect URI for local development is `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/callback/reddit`.
-   **File-Based Sessions:** The client was refactored to use a dedicated `RedditSessionManager` class to handle the storage and retrieval of session data from the `sessions/` directory. This resolved a critical bug where sessions were being lost.

## 5. UI/UX: Workflows and Progressive Disclosure

The UI has been updated to support two distinct, streamlined workflows, selectable via radio buttons:

-   **Analyze a Subreddit:** This workflow uses a "Hybrid Dropdown" with progressive disclosure.
    -   **Initial View:** A single dropdown is populated with `<optgroup>` sections for "Subscribed," "Popular," and "My Posts."
    -   **Progressive Disclosure:** If the user selects a subreddit, a second dropdown is dynamically created and populated with that subreddit's top posts via a call to the new `/api/reddit/posts` endpoint.
-   **Summarize from URL:** This workflow presents a simple input field for the user to paste a Reddit post URL.

In both workflows, the analysis is initiated via the single, main "Start Chat" button, which has been refactored to handle the logic for both cases.

### Image Processing

The `RedditClient` now has robust image fetching capabilities:

-   **Direct Links:** It checks the `submission.url` to see if it's a direct link to an image.
-   **Galleries:** It checks for `submission.is_gallery` and uses `submission.media_metadata` to get the URLs for all images in the gallery.
-   **Inline Links:** It uses a regex to find image URLs in the text of posts and comments.
-   All fetched images are base64 encoded and added to the `attachments` list of the corresponding `Message` object.
