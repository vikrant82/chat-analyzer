# Reddit Backend Integration: Final Implementation Summary

**Document Version:** 3.0 (As-Built)
**Date:** 2025-08-17

## 1. Project Goal & Philosophy

The primary objective was to integrate Reddit as a new, fully-featured backend for the Chat Analyzer application. This involved adapting Reddit's non-traditional, post-and-comment-based structure into the application's existing chat-centric data model.

The guiding philosophy was **"Adaptation at the Edge."** All Reddit-specific logic was successfully confined to the new `RedditClient`, leaving the core application services untouched and ensuring the integration is clean, decoupled, and maintainable.

## 2. Technical Research & Key Decisions

-   **Primary Library:** We selected **`Async PRAW`**, the official asynchronous version of the Python Reddit API Wrapper. This was a critical decision to ensure non-blocking I/O within the application's `asyncio` event loop.
-   **OAuth Scopes:** Through an iterative process, the required OAuth scopes were determined to be `identity`, `read`, `history`, `subscribe`, `vote`, and `mysubreddits`. The `mysubreddits` scope was essential for fetching the list of a user's subscribed communities.

## 3. Data Mapping & Threading (Final Implementation)

The core challenge was mapping Reddit's nested structure to the application's simpler, one-level threading model. The final implementation handles all complexity within the `RedditClient`.

-   **`Chat` -> Hybrid Object:** The `Chat` model is used to represent three different concepts in the UI dropdown:
    -   **Subreddits:** Have an ID prefixed with `sub_` (e.g., `sub_selfhosted`) to be identifiable on the frontend.
    -   **Popular Posts:** Fetched from r/popular.
    -   **User's Posts:** Fetched from the authenticated user's profile.

-   **`Message` -> Post & Pre-Formatted Comment Tree:**
    -   **The Post:** Becomes the first `Message` in the list with `thread_id: None`.
    -   **The Comments:** The `get_messages` method in the `RedditClient` performs a full in-memory traversal of the comment tree. It then **pre-formats** the `text` of each comment `Message` with the correct indentation (`"    " * depth`).
    -   **Grouping:** The `thread_id` for all comments is set to the submission's ID. This allows the existing `chat_service` to group them all into a single conversation, while the pre-formatted text provides the correct visual hierarchy.

-   **`User` -> Redditor:** A direct mapping. `getattr` is used for safe access to attributes like `id` and `name` to prevent errors from deleted users.

## 4. Authentication & Session Management

-   **Mechanism:** Standard OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant flow.
-   **Redirect URI:** The required redirect URI for local development is `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/callback/reddit`.
-   **File-Based Sessions:** The client was refactored to use persistent, file-based sessions stored in the `sessions/` directory, mirroring the behavior of the Telegram and Webex clients. This resolved a critical bug where sessions were being lost.

## 5. UI/UX: The "Hybrid Dropdown"

The final implementation uses a "Hybrid Dropdown" with progressive disclosure.

-   **Initial View:** A single dropdown is populated with `<optgroup>` sections for "Subscribed," "Popular," and "My Posts."
-   **Progressive Disclosure:** If the user selects a subreddit, a second dropdown is dynamically created and populated with that subreddit's top posts via a call to the new `/api/reddit/posts` endpoint.
-   **Sorting:** The `Choices.js` library was explicitly configured with `shouldSort: false` for all dropdowns to ensure the order of items received from the backend (e.g., "hot" posts) is preserved.
