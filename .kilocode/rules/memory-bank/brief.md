### Project: Multi-Backend AI Chat Analyzer

**Objective:** To provide a web application that allows users to securely connect to their personal chat accounts (Telegram, Webex) and use Large Language Models to summarize, query, and analyze their conversation history.

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-Platform Connectivity:** Securely logs into and analyzes chats from both Telegram and Webex.
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Uses configurable LLM backends (Google AI, LM Studio, OpenAI-compatible) for summarization and Q&A.
- **Advanced Threading:** Intelligently reconstructs conversation threads from both platforms to provide accurate context for analysis.
- **Optional Bot Integration:** Allows users to register bots to trigger analysis directly from their chat clients.
- **Flexible Data Export:** Users can download chat transcripts in various formats, including TXT, PDF, and HTML with embedded images.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Backend:** Python with the FastAPI framework.
- **Frontend:** Standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Core Libraries:** Telethon for Telegram client interaction, HTTPX for Webex and bot clients.
- **Deployment:** Docker and Docker Compose for containerization.

**Significance:** This project serves as a powerful personal information management tool and a robust example of building a multi-platform, AI-integrated web application. It demonstrates secure authentication, complex data processing, and a clean, service-oriented architecture.
