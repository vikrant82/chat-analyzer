# Product Vision: Multi-Backend AI Chat Analyzer

## 1. Why It Exists
This project exists to solve the problem of information overload in personal and group chats. Conversations across platforms like Telegram and Webex contain valuable information, but manually reviewing long histories is time-consuming and inefficient. This tool empowers users to quickly extract insights, get summaries, and find specific information without leaving their chat ecosystem.

## 2. Problems It Solves
- **Information Retrieval:** Quickly finds key information from vast chat histories.
- **Contextual Understanding:** Reconstructs conversation threads (especially in confusing platforms like Telegram) to provide accurate context for analysis.
- **Time Savings:** Eliminates the need for manual scrolling and reading by providing AI-powered summaries and Q&A.
- **Accessibility:** Allows users to interact with their own data using natural language, with optional bot integrations for in-app analysis.

## 3. How It Should Work
The user experience is centered around a simple, clean web interface:
1.  **Secure Login:** The user securely authenticates with their chosen chat service (Telegram or Webex) using standard, non-intrusive methods (OAuth for Webex, phone code for Telegram).
2.  **Simple Selection:** The user selects a chat, a date range, and an AI model.
3.  **Initiate Analysis:** With a single click, the application fetches the relevant chat history, processes it, and presents a conversational AI interface.
4.  **Conversational Interaction:** The user can ask for a summary or pose specific questions. The AI maintains context, allowing for natural follow-up questions.
5.  **Flexible Export:** Users can download the conversation transcript and analysis in multiple formats (TXT, PDF, HTML, ZIP) for offline use.
6.  **(Optional) Bot Integration:** Users can register bots to perform these actions directly from their chat clients by mentioning the bot and giving it a command (e.g., `@MyAnalyzerBot summarize last 2 days`).

## 4. User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity:** The interface should be intuitive, requiring minimal technical knowledge.
- **Security:** Users must feel confident that their credentials and chat data are handled securely. Sessions are managed locally, and data is not stored long-term.
- **Speed:** Caching and efficient data processing should provide a responsive experience, especially for historical data.
- **Flexibility:** The tool should support multiple chat platforms and multiple AI backends, giving users control over their tools.
